I am a PhD Candidate in the History, Quantitative, and Theoretical Psychology program at Simon Fraser University. My research alternates between applied psychometric projects, metascientific work exploring conceptual and practical issues in research methodology, and philosophical work related to quantification and measurement in psychological science. My other interests include data science and visualization, primarily via R statistical programming.
